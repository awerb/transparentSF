New filings are available in scanned paper format through the Ethics Commission's <a href=\"https://public.netfile.com/pub2/?aid=sfo\">public disclosure portal</a>.\n\nIn 1997, San Francisco voters approved the Regulation of Campaign Consultants Ordinance (“Ordinance”). The Ordinance requires persons who earn $1,000 or more per year for campaign consultant services to register with the Ethics Commission and file quarterly activity reports. The Ordinance defines “campaign consultant” as a person or entity that receives or is promised $1,000 or more in a calendar year for either campaign management or campaign strategy.",
