    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset includes completed and partially completed building permits that have resulted in the addition or loss of residential units since 2005, through construction of new units, demolition of existing units, or alteration of existing residential structures. This dataset also includes the number of affordable (below market rate) units by their affordability levels.\n \n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nThis data is primarily based on unit-changing permits in DBI’s permit tracking system (PTS). It also includes occasional records related to housing developments that don’t fall under DBI’s purview (e.g. developments on State lands). The completion of permits is determined in different ways: 1) DBI’s data on the issuance of Certificate of Final Completion (CFC) or Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO), which covers the majority of housing unit completions since 2018 2) Permit complete status in DBI’s Permit Tracking System, 3) manual review of Planning Department’s legacy Housing Inventory data going back to 2005. Data on the affordability of units is primarily obtained from MOHCD’s Affordable Pipeline and Affordable Portfolio. When exact data on AMI levels is not available, but the total number of affordable units is known, the AMI levels are estimated based on similar projects. This data is maintained in Planning Department’s Housing Information System. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nThe Planning Department’s Data and Analytics Group (DAG) updates this dataset annually on April 1. The underlying data for this dataset is maintained and updated in Planning Department’s Housing Information System, which is updated through automated data pipelines every day. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nThis dataset can be used to track housing production trends in San Francisco. Note that the first and latest completion dates are often the same because, for most permits, all units are deemed complete at the same time. But if units of a permit are completed at different times (through multiple TCOs/CFC) these dates show the first TCO date and the latest TCO, CFC, or PTS completion date. The latest completion date is not necessarily the same as the final completion date, as the permit may be partially completed, and more units could be expected to be completed in the future. \n\n<strong>E.
