    "description": "<strong>As of July 2nd, 2024 the COVID-19 Deaths by Population Characteristics Over Time dataset has been retired. This dataset is archived and will no longer update. We will be publishing a <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Health-and-Social-Services/COVID-19-Deaths-by-Population-Characteristics/kv9m-37qh/about_data\">cumulative deaths by population characteristics dataset</a></u> that will update moving forward.\n\nA. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset shows San Francisco COVID-19 deaths by population characteristics and by date. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported deaths. Data updates as more information becomes available. Because of this, death totals for previous days may increase or decrease. More recent data is less reliable.\n\nPopulation characteristics are subgroups, or demographic cross-sections, like age, race, or gender. The City tracks how deaths have been distributed among different subgroups. This information can reveal trends and disparities among groups.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAs of January 1, 2023, COVID-19 deaths are defined as persons who had COVID-19 listed as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to their death on their death certificate. This definition is in alignment with the California Department of Public Health and the national <a href = \"https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CSTE-Revised-Classification-of-COVID-19-associated-Deaths.Final_.11.22.22.pdf\">Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists</a>. Death certificates are maintained by the California Department of Public Health.\n\nData on the population characteristics of COVID-19 deaths are from: \n*Case reports \n*Medical records \n*Electronic lab reports \n*Death certificates \n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths. \n\nTo protect resident privacy, we summarize COVID-19 data by only one characteristic at a time. Data are not shown until cumulative citywide deaths reach five or more. \n \nData notes on each population characteristic type is listed below.\n\n<u> Race/ethnicity</u> \n* We include all race/ethnicity categories that are collected for COVID-19 cases.\n\n<u>Gender</u>\n* The City collects information on gender identity using <u><a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM5_SexGenderGuidelines.pdf\">these guidelines</a></u>.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 06:30 and 07:30 AM Pacific Time on Wednesday each week.\n\nDataset will not update on the business day following any federal holiday.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nPopulation estimates are only available for age groups and race/ethnicity categories. San Francisco population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). \n\nThis dataset includes many different types of characteristics. Filter the “Characteristic Type” column to explore a topic area. Then, the “Characteristic Group” column shows each group or category within that topic area and the number of deaths on each date. \n\nNew deaths are the count of deaths within that characteristic group on that specific date. Cumulative deaths are the running total of all San Francisco COVID-19 deaths in that characteristic group up to the date listed.\n\nThis data may not be immediately available for more recent deaths. Data updates as more information becomes available. \n\nTo explore data on the total number of deaths, use <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Deaths-Over-Time/g2di-xufg\">the COVID-19 Deaths Over Time dataset</a></u>.\n\n<strong>E. CHANGE LOG</strong> \n<UL><LI>9/11/2023 - on this date, we began using an updated definition of a COVID-19 death to align with the California Department of Public Health. This change was applied to COVID-19 deaths retrospectively beginning on 1/1/2023. More information about the recommendation by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists that motivated this change can be found <a href = \"https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CSTE-Revised-Classification-of-COVID-19-associated-Deaths.Final_.11.22.22.pdf\">here</a>. \n<LI>6/6/2023 - data on deaths by transmission type have been removed. See section ARCHIVED DATA for more detail.\n<LI>5/16/2023 - data on deaths by sexual orientation, comorbidities, homelessness, and single room occupancy have been removed. See section ARCHIVED DATA for more detail.\n<LI>4/6/2023 - the State implemented system updates to improve the integrity of historical data. \n<LI>1/31/2023 - column “population_estimate” added. \n<LI>3/23/2022 - ‘Native American’ changed to ‘American Indian or Alaska Native’ to align with the census. \n<LI>1/22/2022 - system updates to improve timeliness and accuracy of cases and deaths data were implemented.</UL>",
