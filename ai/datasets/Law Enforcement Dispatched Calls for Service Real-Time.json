    "description": "<i>***Note: As of 12/22/23, Law Enforcement Calls for Service data related to calls that originated from the 311 Connected Worker app and were dispatched from the Healthy Streets Operations Center (HSOC) have been recoded to better capture the nature of these calls. These calls were previously categorized as \"on view\" calls and were hard to distinguish from other types of \"on view\" calls for service where a San Francisco Police Department unit were dispatched based on viewing an incident in the field. They will now be identified using a new value in the onview_flag data field of \"HSOC.\" This affects historic data as well as new data in the Law Enforcement Calls for Service datasets. ***</i>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nLaw Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service – Real-time dataset includes all calls for service  which generate a record in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and typically have a law enforcement unit dispatched to the location. Calls originate from the public via calls to the 911 call center or from law enforcement officers in the field upon viewing an incident (‘On-View’).  \n \nThe Real-time dataset is delayed by 10 minutes, and represents a rolling 48 hour window of calls for service.  It contains both open and closed calls and is updated every 10 minutes.  It is delayed by 10 minutes. Open calls are active calls that are unverified, but being worked by law enforcement. Closed calls are calls that law enforcement have indicated are resolved.  Not all Calls for Service generate a Police Incident Report, so data does not directly correlate to the Police Incidents Report dataset. The dataset contains calls handled by law enforcement which can include Police, MTA parking enforcement, the Sheriff’s Office, and others. All relevant time intervals are also included. Some Calls for Service data is suppressed, due to the nature of the call and privacy concerns related to the incident. \n\nPlease refer <u><a href=\"https://sfdigitalservices.gitbook.io/dataset-explainers/law-enforcement-dispatched-calls-for-service\">Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer</a></u> for full documentation \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>  \nOnce a received 911 call is dispatched, a record (CAD#) is generated in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System.   \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated every 10 minutes with the past 48hrs of open and closed calls that have been dispatched. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nPlease refer <u><a href=\"https://sfdigitalservices.gitbook.io/dataset-explainers/law-enforcement-dispatched-calls-for-service\">Law Enforcement Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer</a></u> for full documentation \n\n<strong>E.
