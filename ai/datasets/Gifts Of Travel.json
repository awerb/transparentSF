    "description": "Under San Francisco Campaign & Governmental Conduct Code Section 3.216(d) elected officers are required to file the Gifts of Travel form before accepting a gift of transportation, lodging, or subsistence for any out-of-state travel that is paid for in part by an individual or entity other than the City and County of San Francisco, another governmental body, or a bona-fide educational institution as defined in section 203 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or that is paid for by the City in whole or in part with funds donated by any of those individuals or entities. An elected officer who reimburses an individual or entity for a gift of transportation, lodging or subsistence related to out-of-state travel must also file this form within 30 days of the reimbursement. For more information visit www.sfethics.org.\n\nEach row on this table represents the contents of a Gifts of Travel form filed with the Ethics Commission.  There are two sub-tables of information on the Gifts of Travel form: Accompanying Persons and Contributors.  These sub-tables are provided in JSON format in the \"AccompanyingPersons\" and \"Contributors\" fields.  The same information may also be accessed via the endpoints provided in \"AccompanyingPersonsSubTableQuery\" and \"ContributorsSubTableQuery\" fields to separate datasets: Accompanying Persons ( https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Gifts-of-Travel-Accompanying-Individuals/gqui-q3n5 )Contributors ( https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Gifts-of-Travel-Contributors/hpj3-vnwh ).  Join the this dataset with the sub-tables using the DocuSignID.\n\nThis dataset includes filings from March 2018 to the present.  For historic filings, see https://data.sfgov.org/d/uqhk-vesf.",
