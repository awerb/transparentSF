    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nLocation data of SFMTA Transit Vehicles. Location information includes reported location date and time, vehicle identifier, location latitude and longitude, heading and speed. This dataset will only contain data for the current calendar year and will reset to the next calendar year the first of every year.  Prior years are saved as separate datasets.\n<strong>B HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nVehicle location data is provided by the SFMTAâ€™s computer aided dispatch and automated vehicle location system. \n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nLocation data is published daily for the previous day, resulting in a lag, up to 24 hours.  \n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nLocation data can be used to visualize vehicle routes and city wide traffic patterns.",
