    "description": "San Francisco Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code section 3.610 requires City elective officers and members of certain boards and commissions to file behested payment reports (Form SFEC-3610(b)) with the Ethics Commission.\n\nEffective September 24, 2020, Mayoral Executive Directive 20-02 requires Department Heads to file behested payment Form SFEC-3610(b) and to comply with the City’s behested payment requirements that apply to City elected officials and members of boards and commissions that are contained in Article III, Chapter 6 of the Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code.\n\nAn officer must file Form SFEC-3610(b) any time a behested payment of $1,000 or more is made at his or her behest by an interested party. An “interested party” is a person who is a party, participant or agent of a party or participant to certain types of proceedings before the official in question. Those proceedings are limited to administrative enforcement proceedings and proceedings regarding permits, licenses, or other entitlements for use. A party to such a proceeding is someone who files an application for a license, permit, or entitlement for use or is the subject of the administrative enforcement. A participant in such a proceeding is someone who is not a party to the proceeding but who actively supports or opposes a particular decision in the proceeding and has a financial interest in the decision. An agent is someone who represents a party or a participant in such a proceeding.\n\nThe filing deadline for Form SFEC-3610(b) depends on the circumstances under which the behested payment was made.\n\nIf the behested payment was made while the proceeding involving the interested party is pending before the official, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment being made. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nIf the behested payment was made within six months following the date on which a final decision was made in the proceeding involving the interested party, then the form must be filed within thirty days of the payment. If there is a series of behested payments, the form is due within 30 days of the payment that makes the total $1,000 or more.\n\nFinally, if the behested payment was made in the 12 months prior to the commencement of the proceeding involving the interested party, the form is due within 30 days of the date the official knew or should have known that the source of the behested payment became an interested party.\n\nEach row in this dataset represents information about the reportable interest with the payee reported in the \"Reportable Interest With Payee\" sub-table of a Form 3610b filed with the Ethics Commission. The parent filing and form data is available in a separate dataset: \"SFEC Form 3610b - City Officer Behested Payment - Filings\" at https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/SFEC-Form-3610b-City-Officer-Behested-Payment-Fili/7vmk-cq9e.
