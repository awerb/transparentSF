    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset shows all projects that satisfied their Inclusionary Housing requirements through one of the options other than on-site affordable units, although some of these projects met requirements through a combination of options that included on-site units. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nDevelopments of 10 or more units that are subject to Planning Code Section 415 fall under the City's Inclusionary Affordable Housing program. Section 415 requires that developers include affordable units on-site or alternatively pay a fee or dedicate land to MOHCD, or build affordable units at another location (off-site).\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset will be updated on an as needed basis.\n\n<strong>D. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<li> <u><a href=\"https://data.staff.sf.gov/Housing-and-Buildings/Mayor-s-Office-of-Housing-and-Community-Developmen/aaxw-2cb8/about_data\">MOHCD Affordable Housing Pipeline</a></u>\n<li> <u><a href=\"https://data.staff.sf.gov/Housing-and-Buildings/Mayor-s-Office-of-Housing-and-Community-Developmen/pyxv-n29e/about_data\">Portfolio</a></u>",
