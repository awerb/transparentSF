    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nFire Calls-For-Service includes all fire units' responses to 911 calls from the city's Computer-Aided Dispatch (“CAD”) system. This includes responses to Medical Incidents requiring EMS staff. Each record includes the call number, incident number, address, unit identifier, call type, and disposition. All relevant time intervals are also included. Because this dataset is based on responses, and since most calls involve multiple units, there are multiple records for each call number. Addresses are associated with an intersection or call box, not a specific address.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is an extract from the Department of Emergency Management’s computer-aided dispatch system. The dataset is enhanced with fire-department specific information before being uploaded to the open data portal.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset updates daily via automated data pipeline.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset is based on responses, and since most calls involve multiple units, there are multiple records for each call number. The most common call types are Medical Incidents, Alarms, Structure Fires, and Traffic Collisions. \n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Incidents/wr8u-xric/about_data\">Fire Incidents</a></u>",
