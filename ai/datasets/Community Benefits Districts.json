    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nCommunity Benefit Districts (CBD), also known as Business Improvement Districts (BIDs), strive to improve the quality of life on commercial and mixed-use corridors. Each district is a partnership between the City and local communities. Local property owners vote to become a CBD and agree to pay an assessment. A nonprofit created by the neighborhood distributes the funding for various improvements.\n\nThis dataset contains the location and other information on each Community Benefits District. See more information on CBDâ€™s  <u><a href=\"https://www.sf.gov/information/community-benefit-districts\">here</a></u>.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe multi-polygons in this dataset were generated in ESRI ArcGIS based on the CBD boundaries.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset will be reviewed annually. During this review process, the revenue data will be updated. It is also possible that the boundaries could be updated during this time. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nUse this dataset to understand the boundaries of each CBD and find links to additional information about them such as revenue generated from each CBD.",
