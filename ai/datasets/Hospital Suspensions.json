    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes system-wide hospital diversion suspension information. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset contains the date and time diversion suspension began and ended. Hospitals can voluntarily declare diversion, which diverts all ambulance transports away from the given hospital excepting specialty care transports. However, when 4 or more hospitals go on diversion at the same time, diversion is suspended system-wide for 4 hours. This is called diversion suspension.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe data is updated monthly by San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nWhen 4 or more San Francisco hospitals declare diversion status, diversion gets suspended for all hospitals. Diversion suspension lasts for 4 hours until it ends and hospitals can declare diversion again. Please refer to the <u><a href=\"https://data.staff.sf.gov/Health-and-Social-Services/Hospital-Diversions/t4sf-777q/\">Hospital Diversions dataset</a></u> for more information on diversion.",
