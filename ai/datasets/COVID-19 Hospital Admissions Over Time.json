    "description": "<strong> As of 9/12/2024, we have resumed reporting on COVID-19 hospitalization data using a San Francisco specific dataset. These new data differ slightly from previous hospitalization data sources but the overall patterns and trends in hospitalizations remain consistent. You can access the previous data <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Health-and-Social-Services/COVID-19-Hospitalizations-Over-Time/nxjg-bhem/about_data\">here.</a></u> </strong>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes information on COVID+ hospital admissions for San Francisco residents into San Francisco hospitals. Specifically, the dataset includes the count and rate of COVID+ hospital admissions per 100,000. The data are reported by week.  \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nHospital admission data is reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) via the COVID Hospital Data Repository (CHDR), a system created via health officer order <u><a href=\"https://www.sf.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/Order-C19-16-Hospitals-Data.pdf\">C19-16</a></u>. The data includes all San Francisco hospitals except for the San Francisco VA Medical Center.\n\nSan Francisco population estimates are pulled from a view based on the <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/SFDPH-reporting-demographics-population-estimates/cedd-86uf\"> San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a></u>. These population estimates are from the 2018-2022 5-year American Community Survey (ACS).\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData updates weekly on Wednesday with data for the past Wednesday-Tuesday (one week lag). Data may change as more current information becomes available. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nNew admissions are the count of COVID+ hospital admissions among San Francisco residents to San Francisco hospitals by week. \n\nThe admission rate per 100,000 is calculated by multiplying the count of admissions each week by 100,000 and dividing by the population estimate.\n\n<strong>E.
