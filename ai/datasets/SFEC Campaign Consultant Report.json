    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nEach campaign consultant must register with the Ethics Commission by filing a registration report and one or more client authorization statements. To remain active, campaign consultants must file a re-registration report annually no later than January 1st. Each quarter, campaign consultants must file a disclosure report. \n\nA campaign consultant must comply with these reporting requirements until the campaign consultant ceases all activity as a campaign consultant and files both a client termination statement for each respective client and a statement of termination with the Ethics Commission. A statement of termination must include all information required of the disclosure report for the period since the campaign consultant's last disclosure report.\n\nFor more information, visit the Ethics Commission’s webpage on <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/guidance/campaign-consultants\">Campaign Consultants</a>.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nData for this dataset is created when campaign consultants electronically file the following reports: \n\nForm 1 – Registration Report\nForm 2 – Re-registration Report\nForm 3 – Quarterly Disclosure Report for Campaign Consultants\nForm 6 – Campaign Consultant Termination Statement\n\nThis dataset contains reports filings starting from 2025, when electronic filing of campaign consultant reports will be required.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is updated via the Socrata Publisher API as needed when form filings are submitted and signed by campaign consultants.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThe unique row identifier for this dataset is “Entry Id”. Depending on the type of report (“ReportType”), not all columns will contain data because of different reporting requirements for the reports.\n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\nFor data on campaign consultant client registration history, visit <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/SFEC-Campaign-Consultant-Client-Authorization-and-/acwz-2ua3/about_data\">SFEC Campaign Consultant Client Authorization and Termination Statement</a>.",
