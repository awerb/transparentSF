    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nSan Francisco’s Existing Buildings Energy Performance Ordinance requires owners of non-residential buildings over 10,000 square feet to annually benchmark and disclose energy performance. On behalf of City agencies, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) benchmarks and reports energy use for a portfolio of approximately 500 public facilities buildings. The performance of public facilities can be examined in an interactive report at bit.ly/SFMunicipalBenchmarking, and annual reports from 2011-present are available there as well.\n \nThis dataset presents the energy performance and basic characteristics for public facilities that is visualized by the SFPUC’s interactive report.  \n \nIn addition, energy performance data for non-municipal buildings (i.e. commercial buildings of 10,000 square feet or larger, and multifamily & mixed-use buildings of 50,000 square feet or larger) is available at: bit.ly/ExistingBuildingsReport\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nIn compliance with California Energy Benchmarking Regulations (CA Public Resources Code Section 25402.10 and CCR Title 20 Section 1680), and San Francisco Existing Buildings Energy Ordinance (Environment Code Chapter 20), the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission provides energy benchmarking services on behalf of municipal facilities. Details for public facilities are compiled from city records, and energy usage is compiled from utility records; related metrics such as energy use intensity are calculated from the combination of such records. Data is subjected to quality assurance validation prior to publication. For additional information regarding data sources and assumptions, please review the \"Data Sources and Assumptions\" page of the Municipal Facilities Energy Benchmarking dashboard: https://bit.ly/SFMunicipalBenchmarking.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated Annually.",
