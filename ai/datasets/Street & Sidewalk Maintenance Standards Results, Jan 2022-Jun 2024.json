    "description": "Since July 2004, San Francisco’s Charter has required the Controller’s Office (CON) to work with San Francisco Public Works (Public Works) to develop and implement street and sidewalk maintenance standards and report out on the City’s condition under the standards. This data file contains street and sidewalk evaluation results from 1/1/2022 to 6/30/2024. Older evaluation results are also available on DataSF but are not comparable due to changes in the way the standards are calculated. You can also access past annual reports in the \"Past Reports\" section of https://www.sf.gov/street-and-sidewalk-maintenance-standards",
