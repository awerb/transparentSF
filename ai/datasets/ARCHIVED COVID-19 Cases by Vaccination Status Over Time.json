    "description": "<strong>On 6/28/2023, data on cases by vaccination status will be archived and will no longer update.</strong>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents San Francisco COVID-19 positive confirmed cases by vaccination status over time, starting January 1, 2021. Cases are included on the date the positive test was collected (the specimen collection date). Cases are counted in three categories: (1) all cases; (2) unvaccinated cases; and (3) completed primary series cases.\n\n1.\tAll cases: Includes cases among all San Francisco residents regardless of vaccination status.\n\n2.\tUnvaccinated cases: Cases are considered unvaccinated if their positive COVID-19 test was before receiving any vaccine. Cases that are not matched to a COVID-19 vaccination record are considered unvaccinated.\n\n3.\tCompleted primary series cases: Cases are considered completed primary series if their positive COVID-19 test was 14 days or more after they received their 2nd dose in a 2-dose COVID-19 series or the single dose of a 1-dose vaccine. These are also called “breakthrough cases.” \n\nOn September 12, 2021, a new case definition of COVID-19 was introduced that includes criteria for enumerating new infections after previous probable or confirmed infections (also known as reinfections). A reinfection is defined as a confirmed positive PCR lab test more than 90 days after a positive PCR or antigen test. The first reinfection case was identified on December 7, 2021. \n\nData is lagged by eight days, meaning the most recent specimen collection date included is eight days prior to today. All data updates daily as more information becomes available.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCase information is based on confirmed positive laboratory tests reported to the City. The City then completes quality assurance and other data verification processes.   Vaccination data comes from the California Immunization Registry (CAIR2). The California Department of Public Health runs CAIR2. Individual-level case and vaccination data are matched to identify cases by vaccination status in this dataset. Case records are matched to vaccine records using first name, last name, date of birth, phone number, and email address.    \n\nWe include vaccination records from all nine Bay Area counties in order to improve matching rates. This allows us to identify breakthrough cases among people who moved to the City from other Bay Area counties after completing their vaccine series. Only cases among San Francisco residents are included. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 08:00 AM Pacific Time each day. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nTotal San Francisco population estimates can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. These population estimates are from the 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). To identify total San Francisco population estimates, filter the view on “demographic_category_label” = “all ages”. \n\nPopulation estimates by vaccination status are derived from our publicly reported vaccination counts, which can be found at <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/rutu-rpar\"> COVID-19 Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time</a>. \n\nThe dataset includes new cases, 7-day average new cases, new case rates, 7-day average new case rates, percent of total cases, and 7-day average percent of total cases for each vaccination category. \n\nNew cases are the count of cases where the positive tests were collected on that specific specimen collection date. The 7-day rolling average shows the trend in new cases. The rolling average is calculated by averaging the new cases for a particular day with the prior 6 days.\n\nNew case rates are the count of new cases per 100,000 residents in each vaccination status group. The 7-day rolling average shows the trend in case rates. The rolling average is calculated by averaging the case rate for a particular day with the prior six days. Percent of total new cases shows the percent of all cases on each day that were among a particular vaccination status.\n\nHere is more information on how each case rate is calculated: \n\n1.\tThe case rate for all cases is equal to the number of new cases among all residents divided by the estimated total resident population. \n\n2.\tUnvaccinated case rates are equal to the number of new cases among unvaccinated residents divided by the estimated number of unvaccinated residents. The estimated number of unvaccinated residents is calculated by subtracting the number of residents that have received at least one dose of a vaccine from the total estimated resident population.   \n   \n3.\tCompleted primary series case rates are equal to the number of new cases among completed primary series residents divided by the estimated number of completed primary series residents. The estimated number of completed primary series residents is calculated by taking the number of residents who have completed their primary series over time and adding a 14-day delay to the “date_administered” column, to align with the definition of “Completed primary series cases” above. \n\n<strong>E. CHANGE LOG</strong> \n<UL><LI>6/28/2023 - data on cases by vaccination status are no longer being updated. This data is currently through 6/20/2023 (as of 6/28/2023) and will not include any new data after this date.  \n<LI>4/6/2023 - the State implemented system updates to improve the integrity of historical data. \n<LI>2/21/2023 - system updates to improve reliability and accuracy of cases data were implemented.\n<LI>1/31/2023 - updated “sf_population” column to reflect the 2020 Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) San Francisco Population estimates. \n<LI>1/31/2023 - renamed column “last_updated_at” to “data_as_of”. \n<LI>1/22/2022 - system updates to improve timeliness and accuracy of cases and deaths data were implemented. \n<LI>7/15/2022 - reinfections added to cases dataset. See section SUMMARY for more information on how reinfections are identified.\n<LI>7/15/2022 - references to “fully vaccinated” replaced with “completed primary series” in column “vaccination_status\".\n<LI>7/15/2022 - rows with “partially vaccinated” in column “vaccination_status” removed from dataset.</UL>",
