    "description": "<strong> As of 9/12/2024, we will begin reporting on hospitalization data again using a new San Francisco specific dataset. Updated data can be accessed <u><a href=\"https://data.staff.sf.gov/Health-and-Social-Services/COVID-19-Hospital-Admissions-Over-Time/82gu-asz5/about_data\">here.</a></u> </strong>\n\n<strong>On 5/1/2024, hospitalization data reporting will change from mandatory to optional for all hospitals nationwide. We will be pausing the refresh of the underlying data beginning 5/2/2024. </strong>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nCount of COVID+ patients admitted to the hospital. Patients who are hospitalized and test positive for COVID-19 may  be admitted to an acute care bed (a regular hospital bed), or an intensive care unit (ICU) bed. This data shows the daily total count of COVID+ patients in these two bed types, and the data reflects totals from all San Francisco Hospitals.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nHospital information is based on admission data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and provided by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically every week.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach record represents how many people were hospitalized on the date recorded in either an ICU bed or acute care bed (shown as Med/Surg under DPHCategory field).\n\nThe dataset shown here includes all San Francisco hospitals and updates weekly with data for the past Sunday-Saturday as information is collected and verified. Data may change as more current information becomes available.\n\n<strong>E. CHANGE LOG</strong><UL><LI>9/12/2024 -Hospitalization data are now being tracked through a new source and are available <u><a href=\"https://data.staff.sf.gov/Health-and-Social-Services/COVID-19-Hospital-Admissions-Over-Time/82gu-asz5/about_data\">here.</a></u>\n<LI> 5/1/2024 - hospitalization data reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) changed from mandatory to optional for all hospitals nationwide. We will be pausing the refresh of the underlying data beginning 5/2/2024. \n<LI> 12/14/2023 – added column “hospitalreportingpct” to indicate the percentage of hospitals who submitted data on each report date.\n<LI> 8/7/2023 - In response to the end of the federal public health emergency on 5/11/2023 the California Hospital Association (CHA) stopped the collection and dissemination of COVID-19 hospitalization data. In alignment with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), hospitalization data from 5/11/2023 onward are being pulled from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). The NHSN data is updated weekly and does not include information on COVID suspected (PUI) patients.\n<LI> 4/9/2021 - dataset updated daily with a four-day data lag.</UL>",
