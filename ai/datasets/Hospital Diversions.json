    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes hospital diversion events declared by San Francisco hospitals.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nSan Francisco hospitals can declare ambulance diversion status, which diverts all ambulance transports away from the hospital of interest except certain specialty calls. This dataset contains number of diversion hours for each hospital. Each record includes the hospital name, the date and time diversion status started, the date and time diversion status ended, and duration of diversion status. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe data is updated monthly by San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nHospitals are allowed to go on diversion for a maximum of 2 hours before they must re-declare diversion. If 4 or more hospitals go on diversion at the same time, diversion is suspended across all hospitals which means that no hospitals can go on diversion for the next 4 hours. The exception is San Francisco General (SFG) hospital. SFG can declare Trauma Override (functionally identical to hospital diversion) while diversion is suspended since it is San Franciscoâ€™s only trauma center. Please refer to the <u><a href=\"https://data.staff.sf.gov/dataset/Hospital-Suspensions/6x9s-ipug/\">Hospital Suspensions dataset</a></u> for more information on diversion suspension.",
