    "description": "<strong>SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes the locations of businesses that pay taxes to the City and County of San Francisco. Each registered business may have multiple locations and each location is a single row. The Treasurer & Tax Collector’s Office collects this data through business registration applications, account update/closure forms, and taxpayer filings. Business locations marked as “Administratively Closed” have not filed or communicated with TTX for 3 years, or were marked as closed following a notification from another City and County Department. \n\nThe data is collected to help enforce the Business and Tax Regulations Code including, but not limited to: Article 6, Article 12, Article 12-A, and Article 12-A-1. http://sftreasurer.org/registration.\n\nTo learn more about using this dataset watch <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JO-s2j30qQ\">this video</a></u>.\nTo update your listing or look up your BAN see this FAQ: \n <u><a href=\"https://sfdigitalservices.gitbook.io/dataset-explainers/registered-business-locations-faq\">Registered Business Locations Explainer</a></u>",
