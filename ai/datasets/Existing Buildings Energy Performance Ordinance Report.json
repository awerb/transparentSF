    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe Existing Buildings Energy Performance Ordinance (Environment Code Chapter 20) requires that each non-residential building with at least 10,000 square feet of conditioned (heated or cooled) space and each residential building with at least 50,000 square feet of conditioned space must be benchmarked annually using Energy Star Portfolio Manager. Each non-residential building specified above is also required to undergo an energy audit, retrocommissioning, or develop a plan for decarbonization at least once every 5 years.\n\nMore information:\n<u><a href=\"http://www.sfenvironment.org/ebo\">San Francisco Existing Buildings Energy Ordinance Website</a></u>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe data is sourced from the benchmark and energy audit reports submitted for compliance with Environment Code Chapter 20. The dataset is presented in two tables which together provide basic characteristics, compliance status, and a public record of reported energy performance.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset will be updated on a monthly basis.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/Existing-Buildings-Basic-Info-and-Audit-Compliance/vgqy-2ca4\">Existing Buildings - Basic Info and Audit Compliance Status</a></u> -- This filtered view contains one record per building and provides basic characteristics (such as size and vintage). For commercial buildings, the table indicates when an energy audit or decarbonization plan is due.\n\n<u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/Existing-Buildings-Benchmark-Reports/4ua7-5sfx\">Existing Buildings - Benchmark Reports</a></u> -- Each row of this filtered view presents one year of benchmarking data for one building – so there are multiple records per building. One year of data includes compliance status, and if the building complied it also presents energy use data including gas, electricity, steam and EPA-estimated operational carbon emissions.\n\nThis dataset contains the information of the two views joined on Parcel Number.",
