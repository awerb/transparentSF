Please see the updated dataset linked below:\n\nhttps://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Sidewalk-Maintenance-Standards-Results-Jan-/qya8-uhsz\n\nThe Controller's Office's City Services Auditor (CSA) Division has worked with the Department of Public Works (DPW) to develop maintenance standards for streets and sidewalks and schedules and inspect for compliance since July 2004, as mandated by 2003 Prop. C. This data file contains street and sidewalk evaluation results from 1/1/2022 to 12/31/22 under the FY19 standards (v4.0).  Older evaluation results are also available on DataSF but are not comparable due to changes in the way the standards are calculated.  You can also access the annual reports in PDF at \"Street Maintenance\" section of http://sfcontroller.org/index.aspx?page=49 or https://sf.gov/resource/2022/street-and-sidewalk-maintenance-standards",
