            "prompt": "Given the following list of metrics with significant changes, identify EXACTLY {max_items} most important items to highlight in a monthly newsletter.\n\nConsider these factors when prioritizing:\n1. Magnitude of the change (both absolute and percentage)\n2. Public importance of the metric (e.g., crime most important, then public safety, then housing, then the rest)\n3. Something interesting or newsworthy about the change\n\nAdditionally, review the year-to-date metrics and notes provided below to determine if each change:\n- Represents a counter-trend (reversing previous patterns), if so choose it only if it is outside of it's normal range. In other words don't alarm people about a recent uptick in crime if its still far lower than it has been in the past and is well within its normal range.\n- Continues a broader trend already in progress\n- Represents a new development that requires special attention\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n{changes_text}\n\nYEAR-TO-DATE METRICS AND NOTES:\n{notes_text[:5000]}\n\nReturn your response as a JSON object with a property named \"items\" that contains an array of EXACTLY {max_items} objects with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"index\": 1,\n      \"metric\": \"Metric Name\",\n      \"metric_id\": \"Metric ID\",\n      \"group\": \"Group Value\",\n      \"priority\": 1,\n      \"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of why this change is significant\",\n      \"trend_analysis\": \"Whether this is a counter-trend or continuation of existing patterns\",\n      \"follow_up\": \"Suggested follow-up questions or additional context\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"index\": 2,\n      ...\n    },\n    ...more items to make exactly {max_items} total\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nVERY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. The \"items\" array MUST contain EXACTLY {max_items} objects, no more and no less.\n2. The \"index\" field MUST match the index number from the list of metrics above. This is essential for accurate processing.\n3. The array must be sorted by priority (1 being highest).\n4. Each object must include the exact metric name from the list above.\n5. The response must be valid JSON that can be parsed directly.\n6. Do not include any commentary or explanation outside the JSON structure.\n\nYou MUST select {max_items} different metrics. This is a hard requirement."

            "system": "You are a professional data scientist and newsletter writer for a transparent SF, a San Francisco  organization edicated to bringing data and accountability into the public discussion.",
            "prompt": "You are tasked with creating a comprehensive, citizen-focused monthly newsletter for San Francisco's {district_name} for {current_month}.\n\nThis is a newsletter for all citizens of San Francisco. The tone should be intelligent but accessible, civic-minded (not partisan), transparent, and focused on impact rather than ideology. Start with a strong accurate headline, present the facts clearly, provide context, and offer a brief takeaway.\n\n Tone: Factual, clear, non-righteous, with occasional dry wit\n- Focus: Impact over ideology, precision over polish\n- Approach: Assume no ill intention from public officials, drive accountability while being fair and data-driven.\n- Style: Clean and clear in design and tone, calm and credible\n\nDISTRICT INFORMATION:\n- District: {district_name}\n- District Official: {official_name} ({official_role})\n\nYOUR GOAL:\nWeave the selected data points below into a cohesive and engaging narrative that tells a story about what happened in the district/city last month. We are bringing data to the public discussion, so you focus on just the what never get into the why. Something like Police Reports, for example could be up due to better police enforcement or due to an actual increase in crime.  It's hard to know why. They could be down due lower crime or down due to lax enforcement. We never know the why, so keep it dry.  Don't use constructions like 'a concerning drop' or an 'unexpected rise', since we don't really know if its concerning or expected. It's good to mention the month in the headline 'March Drug Incidents Up', etc.  It's also good to include the name of the official in the report. \n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **Develop a Narrative:** Explore the explanations, trends, and detailed analysis provided for each item. Identify connections, overlapping themes, or contrasting movements between different metrics.  Feel free to include other supporting metrics if you see an opportunity for it. Arrests are often related to police incidents, convictions must follow arrests, etc. How do Citywide trends relate to District specifics, and vice versa? Build a story around the most significant developments.  It's fine to exclude points if they aren't useful to the narrative as long as they aren't contradictory.\n\nWhen it makes sense, mention the city official when you mention their area of responsibility so 'Daniel Lurie's San Francisco' or 'Connie Chan's District 1'.  District 1, under Connie Chan saw a 14% decrease in X.  When possible emphasize positive developments for public officials over negative ones. \n\nYou also have some citations and context about the item from from a perplexity search that is passed through an AI that is expect at extracting information.  Use this information in the newsletter, but always be sure to include a hyperlink to the actual citation so that everything we show is supported by data that the user can check for themselves. Make the links clear by hyperlinking a few words that summarize the story and putting the domain name to which it links in parenthesis.  This is especially important if you are quoting an elected official. \n\n2. **Structure the Newsletter:** Use a clear structure like this:\n    * **Catchy Headline(s):** Make a compelling headline summarizing the main story (e.g., \"Crime trends down in District 5 \u2014 see what changed\", \"Service requests spike in SoMa: What the data shows\").\n    * **Key Takeaways:** Show a simple and clear explanation of the metrics we are explaining in the newsletter.  Lets show the metric name and the % change from one month to the next, and a very brief explanation, no longer than 1 sentence per metric.  No fluff.  \n * **The Story in Data:** This is the core section. Dive deep into the prioritized metrics. Group related items together. Explain the changes, referencing the data (recent vs. comparison numbers, percentages). Incorporate the 'Detailed Analysis' and 'Trend Analysis' provided.\n    * **Context:** Here we want to get into some explanatory details in the \"what\" changed. Did it happen in a particular district? Was it caused by an anomaly, is it well within its normal range? If you use context information from perplexity, please be sure to link it to the citation from whence it came.\n\n    * **Incorporate Charts Strategically:** Look for opportunities to include charts mentioned in the 'Detailed Analysis' (`report_text`) or indicated by the `Potential Chart` field for each item. Use the specific placeholder format provided (e.g., `[CHART:time_series:123:0:year]` or `[CHART:anomaly:456]`) where you think a chart would be most effective in the narrative flow. Use charts to visually support the narrative, illustrate key trends, or make comparisons clearer. Ensure charts add value and are easy to understand. It's a monthly newsletter so use the month name in the headline and throughout the text.  Remember to summarize changes before explaining them. **Important: Only include charts that are in the explanations, don't make up your own.\n\n4. **Maintain Tone & Style:** Write clearly and accessibly for a general audience while maintaining data integrity. Adhere to the Brand Guidelines.\n\n5. **Format as HTML:** Use appropriate HTML tags (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.) for structure and readability. Just return the HTML, don't put anything in like ''' HTML or any other decimeters. \n\nHere are the data items to build your narrative around:\n\n{report_items_text}\n\nPlease create a professional, well-structured, and narrative-driven newsletter based on these instructions. Make it significantly more detailed and longer than a simple summary."
