            "prompt": "Given the following list of metrics with significant changes, identify EXACTLY {max_items} most important items to highlight in a monthly newsletter.\n\nConsider these factors when prioritizing:\n1. Magnitude of the change (both absolute and percentage)\n2. Public importance of the metric (e.g., crime most important, then public safety, then housing, then the rest)\n3. Something interesting or newsworthy about the change\n\nAdditionally, review the year-to-date metrics and notes provided below to determine if each change:\n- Represents a counter-trend (reversing previous patterns), if so choose it only if it is outside of it's normal range. In other words don't alarm people about a recent uptick in crime if its still far lower than it has been in the past and is well within its normal range.\n- Continues a broader trend already in progress\n- Represents a new development that requires special attention\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n{changes_text}\n\nYEAR-TO-DATE METRICS AND NOTES:\n{notes_text[:5000]}\n\nReturn your response as a JSON object with a property named \"items\" that contains an array of EXACTLY {max_items} objects with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"index\": 1,\n      \"metric\": \"Metric Name\",\n      \"metric_id\": \"Metric ID\",\n      \"group\": \"Group Value\",\n      \"priority\": 1,\n      \"explanation\": \"Detailed explanation of why this change is significant\",\n      \"trend_analysis\": \"Whether this is a counter-trend or continuation of existing patterns\",\n      \"follow_up\": \"Suggested follow-up questions or additional context\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"index\": 2,\n      ...\n    },\n    ...more items to make exactly {max_items} total\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nVERY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. The \"items\" array MUST contain EXACTLY {max_items} objects, no more and no less.\n2. The \"index\" field MUST match the index number from the list of metrics above. This is essential for accurate processing.\n3. The array must be sorted by priority (1 being highest).\n4. Each object must include the exact metric name from the list above.\n5. The response must be valid JSON that can be parsed directly.\n6. Do not include any commentary or explanation outside the JSON structure.\n\nYou MUST select {max_items} different metrics. This is a hard requirement."

            "prompt": "You are tasked with creating a comprehensive, citizen-focused monthly newsletter for {district_name} for {current_month}.\n\nThis is a newsletter for all citizens of San Francisco. The tone should be intelligent but accessible, civic-minded (not partisan), transparent, and focused on impact rather than ideology. Aim for a style similar to the provided example: start with a strong statement, present the facts clearly, provide context, and offer a brief takeaway.\n\n Tone: Factual, clear, non-righteous, with occasional dry wit\n- Focus: Impact over ideology, precision over polish\n- Approach: Assume no ill intention from public officials, drive accountability while being fair and data-driven.\n- Style: Clean and clear in design and tone, calm and credible\n\nDISTRICT INFORMATION:\n- District: {district_name}\n- District Official: {official_name} ({official_role})\n\nYOUR GOAL:\nWeave the selected data points below into a cohesive and engaging narrative that tells a story about what happened in the district/city last month. We are bringing data to the public discussion, so you focus on just the what never get into the why. Something like Police Reports, for example could be up due to better polcie enforcement or due to an actual increase in crime.  It's hard to know why. They could be down or down due to lax enforcement or an actual decrease. We never know the why, so keep it dry.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n It's good to mention the month in the headline 'March Drug Incidents Up', etc.  It's also good to include the name of the official in the report. 1. **Develop a Narrative:** Explore the explanations, trends, and detailed analysis provided for each item. Identify connections, overlapping themes, or contrasting movements between different metrics. How do Citywide trends relate to District specifics, and vice versa? Build a story around the most significant developments.\n2. **Structure the Newsletter:** Use a clear structure like this:\n    * **Catchy Headline(s):** Suggest 1-2 compelling headlines summarizing the main story (e.g., \"Crime trends down in District 5 â€” see what changed\", \"Service requests spike in SoMa: What the data shows\").\n    * **Key Takeaways:** A brief paragraph summarizing the main narrative and key findings. * **The Story in Data:** This is the core section. Dive deep into the prioritized metrics. Group related items together. Explain the changes, referencing the data (recent vs. comparison numbers, percentages). Incorporate the 'Detailed Analysis' and 'Trend Analysis' provided.\n    * **Context:** Here we want to get into some explanatory details in the \"what\" changed. Did it happen in a particular district? Was it caused by an anomaly, is it well within its normal range?\n    * **Incorporate Charts Strategically:** Look for opportunities to include charts mentioned in the 'Detailed Analysis' (`report_text`) or indicated by the `Potential Chart` field for each item. Use the specific placeholder format provided (e.g., `[CHART:time_series:123:0:year]` or `[CHART:anomaly:456]`) where you think a chart would be most effective in the narrative flow. Use charts to visually support the narrative, illustrate key trends, or make comparisons clearer. Ensure charts add value and are easy to understand. It's a monthly newsletter so use the month name in the headline and throughout the text.  Remember to summarize changes before explaining them. **Important: Only include charts that are in the explanations, don't make up your own.\n4. **Maintain Tone & Style:** Write clearly and accessibly for a general audience while maintaining data integrity. Adhere to the Brand Guidelines.\n5. **Format as HTML:** Use appropriate HTML tags (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.) for structure and readability.\n\nHere are the data items to build your narrative around:\n\n{report_items_text}\n\nPlease create a professional, well-structured, and narrative-driven newsletter based on these instructions. Make it significantly more detailed and longer than a simple summary."
