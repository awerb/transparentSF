    "description": "<strong>A.\tSUMMARY</strong>\nThis information shows SFO’s Nighttime Preferential Runway Use program and air carrier operations using jet and regional aircraft. The Nighttime Preferential Runway Use program aims to maximize overwater departures and minimize flights over residential areas between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. to reduce aircraft noise in surrounding communities. The preferred departing runways during these hours are Runways 10 Left (10L) / 10 Right (10R), 1 Left (1L) / 1 Right (1R), or 28 Left (28L) / 28 Right (28R) with an immediate right-turn; when safety, weather, and traffic operations permit. Although the program cannot be used 100% of the time due to these factors, all stakeholders work together to maximize its use when conditions allow. This dataset also provides air carrier total monthly departures and monthly arrivals by runway, along with percent utilization. \n\n<strong>B.\tHOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nDetails of flights from the Federal Aviation Administration’s National Offload Program are processed into SFO’s Airport Noise and Operations Management System (ANOMS) where reports are generated. It serves to quantify, analyze, and report on runway usage in support of programs to help reduce aircraft noise in communities surrounding SFO.\n\n<strong>C.\tUPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData is available starting in January 2005 and will be updated monthly.\n\n<strong>D.\tHOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis information is the data source used in producing the Runway Usage and Nighttime Operations sections (page 4) of the Airport Director’s Reports. These reports are presented at the SFO Airport Community Roundtable Meetings and available online at https://noise.flysfo.com/reports/?category=airport-directors-report\n\nPlease contact the Noise Abatement Office at NoiseAbatementOffice@flysfo.com for any questions regarding this data.\n\n<strong>E.\tRELATED DATASETS</strong>\nOther related datasets are Aircraft Noise Reports, Late Night Aircraft Departures, Flight Operations, Aircraft Noise Climates, and Noise Exceedance Rating.\n\nDate created: September 27, 2023",
