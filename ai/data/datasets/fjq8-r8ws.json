    "description": "Average quarterly park evaluation scores from Q3 FY2005 to Q4 FY2014. These scores are collected and reported pursuant to 2003's Prop C, which requires city agencies to establish and publish standards for street, sidewalk, and park maintenance. Beginning FY2015 a new methodology was developed to evaluate parks, therefore these scores should not form the basis of direct comparisons with scores reported in FY2015 and onward. FY2015 data onward is published and maintained by the SF Controller's Office.",
