    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains the list of intersecting <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/f2zs-jevy\">2022 Supervisor Districts</a></u> and <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/srq6-hmpi\">ZIP Codes</a></u> for the City and County of San Francisco. It can be used to identify which ZIP codes overlap with Supervisor Districts (2022) and vice verse.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset was created with a spatial join between the 2022 Supervisor districts and ZIP codes. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis is a static dataset \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset is a many-to-many relationship between supervisor districts and ZIP codes. A single supervisor district can contain or intersect with multiple ZIP codes and similarly, a single ZIP code can be in multiple supervisor districts. This dataset does not contain geographic boundary data (i.e. shapefiles/ GEOMs). The datasets below containing geographic boundary data should be used for analysis of data with geographic coordinates.\n\n<strong>E.
