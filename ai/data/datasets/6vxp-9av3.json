    "description": "<strong>In early February 2024, we will be retiring the Mpox Vaccinations Given to SF Residents Over Time dataset. This dataset will be archived and no longer update. A historic record of this data will remain available </strong>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY </strong>\nThis dataset represents doses of mpox vaccine (JYNNEOS) administered in California to residents of San Francisco ages 18 years or older. This dataset only includes doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine given on or after 5/1/2022. All vaccines given to people who live in San Francisco are included, no matter where the vaccination took place.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED </strong>\nInformation on doses administered to those who live in San Francisco is from the  <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS </strong>\nUpdated daily via automated process.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET </strong>\nEach row reflects the number of first, second, and total doses administered on that date and up through that date.\n\n<strong>E. CHANGE LOG </strong>\n<ul><li>UPDATE 1/3/2023: Due to low case numbers, this page will no longer include vaccinations after 12/31/2022.</li></ul>",
