    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains the underlying data for the  <u><a href=\"https://www.sf.gov/vision-zero-benchmarking\">Vision Zero Benchmarking website</a></u>. \nVision Zero is the collaborative, citywide effort to end traffic fatalities in San Francisco. \nThe goal of this benchmarking effort is to provide context to San Franciscoâ€™s work and progress on key Vision Zero metrics alongside its peers. The Controller's Office City Performance team collaborated with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the San Francisco Police Department, and other stakeholders on this project. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe Vision Zero Benchmarking website has seven major metrics. The City Performance team collected the data for each metric separately, cleaned it, and visualized it on the website. This dataset has all seven metrics and some additional underlying data. The majority of the data is available through public sources, but a few data points came from the peer cities themselves. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset is for historical purposes only and will not be updated. To explore more recent data, visit the source website for the relevant metrics.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset contains all of the Vision Zero Benchmarking metrics. Filter for the metric of interest, then explore the data. Where applicable, datasets already include a total. For example, under the Fatalities metric, the \"Total Fatalities\" category within the metric shows the total fatalities in that city. Any calculations should be reviewed to not double-count data with this total. \n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n N/A",
