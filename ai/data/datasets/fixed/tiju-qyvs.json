    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nSan Francisco International Airport (SFO) monitors aircraft noise levels on the San Francisco Peninsula 24/7 for analysis and reporting.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nLouder aircraft noise events are of particular interest. As a result, the Noise Exceedance dataset was developed from noise events correlated to SFO aircraft operations.  An exceedance is a noise event greater than the defined maximum level thresholds for Daytime and Nighttime periods at each noise monitor site. One aircraft operation can cause noise events at numerous monitors, which may become noise exceedances.\n\nThe maximum level thresholds for each noise monitor site are listed below.\n\nSite - Daytime (7 a.m. to 9:59:59 p.m.), Nighttime (10 p.m. to 6:59:59 a.m.)\nSite 1 - greater than 104.9 dBA, 94.9 dBA\nSite 2 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 3 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 4 - greater than 104.9 dBA, 94.9 dBA\nSite 5 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 6 - greater than 94.9 dBA, 84.9 dBA\nSite 7 - greater than 84.9 dBA, 74.9 dBA \nSite 8 - greater than 94.9 dBA, 84.9 dBA\nSite 9 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 10 - greater than 94.9 dBA, 84.9 dBA\nSite 11 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 12 - greater than 79.9 dBA, 69.9 dBA\nSite 13 - greater than 84.9 dBA, 74.9 dBA\nSite 14 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA \nSite 15 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 16 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 17 - greater than 84.9 dBA, 74.9 dBA\nSite 18 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 19 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 20 - greater than 79.9 dBA, 69.9 dBA\nSite 21 - greater than 79.9 dBA, 69.9 dBA\nSite 22 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 23 - greater than 79.9 dBA, 69.9 dBA\nSite 24 - greater than 79.9 dBA, 69.9 dBA\nSite 25 - greater than 89.9 dBA, 79.9 dBA\nSite 26 - greater than 84.9 dBA, 74.9 dBA\nSite 27 - greater than 79.9 dBA, 69.9 dBA\nSite 28 - greater than 79.9 dBA, 69.9 dBA\nSite 29 - greater than 84.9 dBA, 74.9 dBA\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData is available starting January 2005 and will be updated monthly.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nIt is important to note, that this dataset is of SFO aircraft departing and/or landing at SFO correlated to a noise event and not flight activities associated with other airports in the Bay Area region. This information is the data source for the Exceedance figure in the Aircraft Noise Levels Summary section (page 1) of the Airport Director\u2019s Report. This report is presented at the SFO Airport Community Roundtable Meetings and available online at https://noise.flysfo.com/reports/?category=airport-directors-report\n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\nOther provided datasets are Noise Exceedance Rating, Aircraft Noise Reports, Late Night Aircraft Departures, Air Carrier Runway Use, and Late Night Preferential Runway Use, Aircraft Noise Climates, and Flight Operations.\n\nPlease contact the Noise Abatement Office at NoiseAbatementOffice@flysfo.com for any questions regarding this data.\n\nDate created: April 23, 2024\n\nhttps://noise.flysfo.com/data-reports/published-reports/report-archive/?wdt_search=director",
