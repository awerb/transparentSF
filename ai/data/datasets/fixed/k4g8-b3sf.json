    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset includes unintentional drug overdose death rates by race/ethnicity by year. This dataset is created using data from the California Electronic Death Registration System (CA-EDRS) via the Vital Records Business Intelligence System (VRBIS). Substance-related deaths are identified by reviewing the cause of death. Deaths caused by opioids, methamphetamine, and cocaine are included. Homicides and suicides are excluded. Ethnic and racial groups with fewer than 10 events are not tallied separately for privacy reasons but are included in the \u201call races\u201d total.   \n\nUnintentional drug overdose death rates are calculated by dividing the total number of overdose deaths by race/ethnicity by the total population size for that demographic group and year and then multiplying by 100,000. The total population size is based on estimates from the <u><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-counties-detail.html\">US Census Bureau County Population Characteristics for San Francisco, 2022 Vintage</a></u> by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin. \n\nThese data differ from the data shared in the <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/dataset/Preliminary-Accidental-Drug-Overdose-Deaths/jxrr-bmra\"> Preliminary Unintentional Drug Overdose Death by Year dataset </a></u> since this dataset uses finalized counts of overdose deaths associated with cocaine, methamphetamine, and opioids only.  \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nThis dataset is created by copying data from the <u><a href=\"https://www.csuhsf.org/substance-use-trends-san-francisco\">Annual Substance Use Trends in San Francisco report</a></u> from the San Francisco Department of Public Health Center on Substance Use and Health. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nThis dataset will be updated annually, typically at the end of the year. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nN/A  \n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong> \n<u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/ed3a-sn39\">Overdose-Related 911 Responses by Emergency Medical Services</a></u> \n<u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/jxrr-bmra\">Preliminary Unintentional Drug Overdose Deaths</a></u> \n<u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/ubf6-e57x\">San Francisco Department of Public Health Substance Use Services</a></u>\n\n<strong>F. CHANGE LOG</strong> \n<UL><LI>12/16/2024 - Updated with 2023 data. Asian/Pacific Islander race/ethnicity group was changed to Asian. \n<LI>12/16/2024 - Past year totals by race/ethnicity were revised after obtaining accurate race/ethnicity for some decedents that were previously marked as \u201cunknown\u201d race/ethnicity.",
