    "description": "This database lists records of rodent treatments primarily in the City's combined sewer system. The data is collected and submitted by the current holder of the Citywide Integrated Pest Management contract. Rodent treatments are listed by location and by amount of product used. These data will be linked with other public data to provide informational tools in support of the City's Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program and Vector Control Program, administered by the Department of the Environment and Department of Public Health, respectively. Providing public access to such data is in keeping with the recordkeeping and transparency requirements of the IPM Ordinance, Environment Code, Chapt. 3. For more information on San Francisco's IPM program, see www.sfenvironment.org/ipm; for information on the City's Vector Control Program, see https://www.sfdph.org/dph/EH/Vector/default.asp.",
