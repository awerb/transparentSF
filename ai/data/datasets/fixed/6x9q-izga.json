    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset includes aggregated metrics of ambulance patient offload time for ambulance transports to San Francisco hospitals. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset contains aggregated data by hospital and month for two metrics: 90th percentile of ambulance patient offload time (APOT) and number of patients by discrete APOT category. The dataset also includes systemwide data for both metrics. <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&sectionNum=1797.120.5.\">APOT is defined</a> as the interval between the arrival of an ambulance patient at an emergency department and the time that the patient is transferred to an emergency department gurney, bed, chair, or other acceptable location and the emergency department assumes responsibility for care of the patient.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe data is updated monthly by San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset is based on EMS patient care reports received from a state database. Please note that you must first filter by Hospital_full and Metric_unit before aggregating the Value field.",
