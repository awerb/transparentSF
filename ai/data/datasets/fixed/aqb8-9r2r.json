    "title": "Nighttime High Power Run-ups",
    "description": "<strong>A.\tSUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset shows the amount of nighttime engine high power run-ups from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. by air carrier operations using jet and regional jet aircraft.  Power run-up activities are conducted at designated locations on the airfield, furthest from residential communities, and monitored by SFO to manage nighttime noise. A power run-up is a procedure used to test an aircraft engine or aircraft system after maintenance or repair is performed. The aircraft engines' throttle settings can range from ground idle to high power and the length of the operational checks may vary in duration. These checks are required to ensure normal operating standards are met, prior to returning the aircraft to service.\n\n<strong>B.\tHOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nDetails of each power run-up are logged into the Airport Operations System. It serves to help quantify, analyze, and report on power run-up activities in support of programs to reduce aircraft noise in communities surrounding SFO.\n\n<strong>C.\tUPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData is available starting in January 2005 and will be updated monthly.\n\n<strong>D.\tHOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis information is the data source used in producing the Nighttime Power Run-ups section (page 4) of the Airport Director\u2019s Reports. These reports are presented at the SFO Airport Community Roundtable Meetings and available online at https://noise.flysfo.com/reports/?category=airport-directors-report\n\nPlease contact the Noise Abatement Office at NoiseAbatementOffice@flysfo.com for any questions regarding this data.\n\n<strong>E.\tRELATED DATASETS</strong>\nOther related datasets are Aircraft Noise Reports, Late Night Aircraft Departures, Runway Usage, Flight Operations, Aircraft Noise Climates, and Noise Exceedance Rating.\n\nData is available starting in January 2005 and will be updated monthly.",
