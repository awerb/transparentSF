It includes summary data for the last 30 days. Summaries are presented by station area. The summary data includes number of calls and average response time (in minutes). Calls are further divided into emergency calls (Code 3) and non-emergency calls (Code 2).<br />\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong><br />\nFilters are applied to the raw data by selecting only the calls for the last 30 full days. The last day included in the dataset is the day before the day the dataset is extracted.<br />\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong><br />\nData is updated every day.<br />\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong><br />\nThis dataset is just a summary of the existing Calls For Service Data. It is provided as a simple way for a user to collect this information.<br />",
