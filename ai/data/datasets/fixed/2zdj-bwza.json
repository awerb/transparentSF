    "description": "<i>Note: All call locations are mapped to nearby intersections to ensure anonymity. Call locations reported before April 24, 2024 are currently mapped to a slightly different set of intersections than those reported on or after April 24. This may result in slight reporting irregularities for analyses that span this date. We will harmonize all historical data and resolve this as soon as possible.</i>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>  \nDispatched Calls-For-Service \u2013 Closed Calls includes all calls for service which generate a record in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System, and typically have a law enforcement unit dispatched to the location. Calls originate from the public via calls to the 911 call center or from law enforcement officers in the field upon viewing an incident (\u2018On-View\u2019). The Closed Calls dataset includes only calls for service that have been closed, and is updated every 24 hours, to include the initial call type, final call type and call disposition. Not all Calls for Service generate a Police Incident Report, so data does not directly correlate to the Police Incidents Report dataset. All relevant time intervals are also included. Dataset contains calls handled by law enforcement which can include Police, MTA parking enforcement, the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and others. Some Calls for Service data is suppressed, due to the nature of the call and privacy concerns related to the incident. \n\nPlease refer to the <u><a href=\"https://sfdigitalservices.gitbook.io/dataset-explainers/law-enforcement-dispatched-calls-for-service\"> Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer </a></u> for full documentation\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>  \nOnce a received 911 call is dispatched, a record (CAD#) is generated in the Department of Emergency Management's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System.   \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily at 2:00am with previous days data.  \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nPlease refer <u><a href=\"https://sfdigitalservices.gitbook.io/dataset-explainers/law-enforcement-dispatched-calls-for-service\"> Dispatched Calls for Service Explainer </a></u>  for full documentation. \n<i>Note: As of 12/22/23, Law Enforcement Calls for Service data related to calls that originated from the 311 Connected Worker app and were dispatched from the Healthy Streets Operations Center (HSOC) have been recoded to better capture the nature of these calls. These calls were previously categorized as \"on view\" calls and were hard to distinguish from other types of \"on view\" calls for service where a San Francisco Police Department unit were dispatched based on viewing an incident in the field. They will now be identified using a new value in the onview_flag data field of \"HSOC.\" This affects historic data as well as new data in the Law Enforcement Calls for Service datasets.</i>\n\n<strong>E.
