    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset is used to report on public dataset access and usage within the open data portal. Each row sums the amount of users who access a dataset each day, grouped by access type (API Read, Download, Page View, etc).\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is created by joining two internal analytics datasets generated by the SF Open Data Portal. We remove non-public information during the process. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset is scheduled to update every 7 days via ETL.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can help you identify stale datasets, highlight the most popular datasets and calculate other metrics around the performance and usage in the open data portal.\n\nPlease note a special call-out for two fields:\n- \"derived\": This field shows if an asset is an original source (derived = \"False\") or if it is made from another asset though filtering (derived = \"True\"). Essentially, if it is derived from another source or not. \n- \"provenance\": This field shows if an asset is \"official\" (created by someone in the city of San Francisco) or \"community\" (created by a member of the community, not official). All community assets are derived as members of the community cannot add data to the open data portal.",
