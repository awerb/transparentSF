    "description": "<strong> Please see <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/San-Francisco-Land-Use-2023/fdfd-xptc/about_data\">Map of Land Use - 2023 </a></u> for most recent data </strong>\n\n<strong>Summary</strong>\nLand Use 2020: Land use categories for every parcel in San Francisco. The land use categories are derived from a range of City and commercial databases. Where building square footages were missing from these databases they were derived from a LIDAR survey flown in 2007.\n\nLand use categories are as follows (units are square feet):\n- CIE = Cultural, Institutional, Educational\n- MED = Medical\n- MIPS = Office (Management, Information, Professional Services)\n- MIXED = Mixed Uses (Without Residential)\n- MIXRES = Mixed Uses (With Residential)\n- PDR = Industrial (Production, Distribution, Repair)\n- RETAIL/ENT = Retail, Entertainment\n- RESIDENT = Residential\n- VISITOR = Hotels/Motels\n- VACANT = Vacant\n- ROW = Right-of-Way\n- OPENSPACE = Open Space\n\nOther attributes are:\n- RESUNITS = Residential Units\n- BLDGSQFT = Square footage data\n- YRBUILT = year built\n- TOTAL_USES = Business points from Dun & Bradstreet were spatially aggregated to the closest parcel, and this field is the sum of the square footage fields\n\nThe subsequent fields (CIE, MED, MIPS, RETAIL, PDER & VISITOR) were derived using the NAICS codes supplied in the Dun & Bradstreet dataset, and the previous TOTAL_USES column.\n\nPREDOMINANT LAND USES:\n- RESIDENTIAL: Housing--from single family to multifamily to high-rise apartment complexes.\n- CIE - CULTURAL, INDUSTRIAL, EDUCATIONAL:Any cultural, institutional, medical or educational place such as a museum, zoo, hospital, medical center, college, theatre, social service, or membership organization.\n- MIPS (generally for offices):Management, information, and professional activities such as finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE), business, legal, and public administration.\n- RETAIL/ENT(Retail/Entertainment)Shopping and direct consumer services, amusement, recreation and personal services, restaurants and bars -- from neighborhood-serving to region-serving.\n- PDR (Production/Distribution/Repair):Wholesale trade, showrooms, manufacturing and materials processing, warehousing, repair, businesses, construction, transportation, communications, utilities.\n- VISITOR:Hotels and motels.PUBLIC:Publicly owned parks, recreation, and open spaces, as well as some highway right of ways.\n- VACANT:An empty or undeveloped lot.\n- MIXED USES:Combined uses, such as office and retail, industrial-retail-entertainment, or industrial and office, etc. where no one use predominates.\n- MIXEDRES (Residential Mixed):Mostly housing with one or more other use (office, retail, industrial)on the ground floor).\n\nThe determining factor for a parcel's LANDUSE is if the square footage of any non-residential use is 80% or more of its total uses. Otherwise it becomes MIXED.\n\nIn the case where RESIDENT use has some square footage of non-residential use, this is mainly accessory uses such as home businesses, freelancers, etc.",
