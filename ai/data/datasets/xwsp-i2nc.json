    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nSection 3.217 of the Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code requires each Department Head to disclose payments that their department receives from a source that is not a federal, state, or local government and for which the department does not provide equal or greater consideration.\n\nEach department accepting gifts will disclose all gifts received during the calendar month from a source that is not a federal, state, or local government. Departments will be expected to submit one disclosure form covering all gifts received in the preceding calendar month, when applicable.\n\nThis dataset provides detailed information about individual gifts reported by departments, such as the gift donor name, date of gift receipt, and gift value.\n\nFor more information, visit the Ethics Commission’s webpage on <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/guidance/city-officers/gifts-and-travel-city-officers/gifts-to-city-departments\">Gifts to city departments</a>.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nData for this dataset is created when departments file the gifts disclosure form provided by the Ethics Commission, starting in December 2024. This form is due within 15 calendar days after the end of the month the department received the gift(s). If a department has not received any gifts in a given month, no filing is necessary.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe dataset is updated via the Socrata Publisher API as needed when form filings are submitted and signed by city departments.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThe unique row identifier for this dataset is “Entry Id”, which is obtained by adding an index to the “Envelope Id”. The “Filing Series” column can be used to identify the filing period (year and month) and department of each gift entry. For full context, this dataset should be joined with the Cover Page dataset by the Envelope Id column.\n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\nFor an overview of each department filing and any amendment filings, visit the associated dataset <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/SFEC-Departmental-Gifts-Disclosure-Cover-Page/8m6p-t372/about_data\">SFEC Departmental Gifts Disclosure Cover Page</a>.\n\nA combined view of both datasets is also available: <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/SFEC-Departmental-Gifts-Disclosure-Joined-View/uac5-pxnx/about_data\">SFEC Departmental Gifts Disclosure Joined View</a>.",
