    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset represents San Francisco COVID-19 related deaths by day. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported deaths. Data updates as more information becomes available. Because of this, death totals for previous days may increase or decrease. More recent data is less reliable.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nAs of January 1, 2023, COVID-19 deaths are defined as persons who had COVID-19 listed as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to their death on their death certificate. This definition is in alignment with the California Department of Public Health and the national <a href = \"https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CSTE-Revised-Classification-of-COVID-19-associated-Deaths.Final_.11.22.22.pdf\">Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists</a>. Death data is provided by the California Department of Public Health.\n\nIt takes time to process this data. Because of this, death totals may increase or decrease over time.\n\nData are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco COVID-19 deaths.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdates automatically at 06:30 and 07:30 AM Pacific Time on Wednesday each week.\n\nDataset will not update on the business day following any federal holiday.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset shows new deaths and cumulative deaths by date of death. New deaths are the count of deaths on that specific date. Cumulative deaths are the running total of all San Francisco COVID-19 deaths up to the date listed.\n\nUse the <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/kkr3-wq7h\">Deaths by Population Characteristics Over Time dataset</a> to see deaths by different subgroups including race/ethnicity, age, and gender.\n\n<strong>E. CHANGE LOG</strong> \n<UL><LI>9/11/2023 – on this date, we began using an updated definition of a COVID-19 death to align with the California Department of Public Health. This change was applied to COVID-19 deaths retrospectively beginning on 1/1/2023. More information about the recommendation by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists that motivated this change can be found <a href = \"https://preparedness.cste.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CSTE-Revised-Classification-of-COVID-19-associated-Deaths.Final_.11.22.22.pdf\">here</a>. \n<LI>4/6/2023 - the State implemented system updates to improve the integrity of historical data. \n<LI>1/22/2022 - system updates to improve timeliness and accuracy of cases and deaths data were implemented.</UL>",
