    "description": "For up to date data starting in 2018, please go to the new dataset at: https://data.sfgov.org/d/wg3w-h783\n\nAs of May 2018, the feed from the legacy mainframe CABLE was discontinued. It was extremely prone to issues and caused many delays in data accessibility. The new dataset linked above comes from the Crime Data Warehouse, a more reliable data system maintained by the Police Department.\n\nThis data will undergo a minor update to conform more closely to the schema of the new dataset. We will post a change notice when that work is planned. This change will not include adding new fields or backfilling data. It is provided as is. We are keeping data from the two systems separate to make it transparent to data users that there were fundamental changes.",
