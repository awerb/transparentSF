    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nSan Francisco International Airport (SFO) keeps track of historical flight operations, also known as aircraft RADAR data for analysis and reporting.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nDetails of flights from the Federal Aviation Administration’s National Offload Program are processed into SFO’s Airport Noise and Operations Management System (ANOMS) where it is correlated with noise reports from the communities and to noise levels collected from noise monitor sites on the San Francisco Peninsula. In ANOMS, various analysis gates (imaginary vertical curtain in space) are used to identify which route flights flew departing and arriving SFO. It serves to quantify, analyze, respond to noise concerns, and report on Runway Use and various programs to reduce aircraft noise in communities surrounding SFO.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData is available starting in August 2019 and will be updated monthly.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nIt is important to note, that this dataset is of flights departing and landing at SFO only and not flight activities associated with other airports in the Bay Area region. This information is the data source used to produce the Flight Operations sections (pages 3-5) of the Airport Director’s Report. These reports are presented at the SFO Airport Community Roundtable Meetings and available online at https://noise.flysfo.com/reports/?category=airport-directors-report\n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/c3tb-f695\">Unique Flight Operations</a> - This filtered view contains unique records of flight operations. For example, one record for a flight that departed SFO or one record for a flight that landed at SFO.\n\n<a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/k3hb-m3dm\">Arrival and Departure Routes</a> - This filtered view contains records of flights with details of analysis gate(s) the aircraft flight track penetrates, to derive which route was used to depart and land at SFO.\n\nThis dataset contains Operations and Arrival and Departure Routes joined on operation_number.  The field gate_penetration is derived by ordering the arrival and departure routes for each operation over gate_penetration_time. Unique_identifier is then created by joining operation_number and gate_penetration.\n\nOther provided datasets are Aircraft Noise Reports, Late Night Aircraft Departures, Air Carrier Runway Use, and Late Night Preferential Runway Use, Aircraft Noise Climates, and Noise Exceedance Rating.\n\nPlease contact the Noise Abatement Office at NoiseAbatementOffice@flysfo.com for any questions regarding this data.\n\nDate created: November 17, 2023",
