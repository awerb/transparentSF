    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThe Municipal Natural Gas Equipment Inventory serves to catalog natural gas-fueled equipment used in municipally owned buildings. \nThis inventory, implemented by the SF Environment Department, aims to establish an understanding of the scope of work needed to electrify municipal buildings and inform an effective and collaborative planning process.\nThis effort was identified as an action in Section BO-2.4 of the  <u><a href=\"https://www.sfenvironment.org/files/events/2021_climate_action_plan.pdf\">2021 Climate Action Plan</a></u> and is included in the <u><a href=\"https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/san_francisco/latest/sf_environment/0-0-0-577\">Environment Code Chapter 7</a></u> (Municipal Green Building Requirements). \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe list of buildings required to report data for the Municipal Natural Gas Equipment Inventory was compiled by cross-referencing the Cityâ€™s  <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/City-Facilities/nc68-ngbr/about_datax\">Facility Systems of Record</a></u> and the  <u><a href=\"https://sfpuc.org/about-us/reports/municipal-buildings-energy-benchmarking\">2020 municipal benchmarking report</a></u> to identify all city-owned buildings with non-zero carbon emissions. Numerous municipal buildings are exempt from these reporting requirements, including facilities of the Port of San Francisco and buildings with a primary purpose of providing collection, storage, treatment, delivery, distribution, and/or transmission of water, wastewater, and/or power utilities. \nEach department received an inventory template, provided by the Environment Department, to submit high level building data and detailed information on each piece of natural gas equipment in use in these buildings. Departments were asked to self-report the required building and equipment data over the course of a 6-month data collection period in 2023 and are asked to keep this inventory up to date in the following years as equipment is replaced. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe inventory will be regularly updated by department representatives via the inventory PowerApp. When a gas-powered equipment item is retired or replaced, departments are asked to mark it as no longer in use and provide information on any electric replacement equipment, if applicable. While departments have the flexibility to update the inventory at any time, they are encouraged to do so at 6 month intervals at the minimum. \n\nUpdated inventory data will be automatically reflected in this dataset. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nIt is important to note that this dataset does not include facilities of the Port of San Francisco and buildings with a primary purpose of providing collection, storage, treatment, delivery, distribution, and/or transmission of water, wastewater, and/or power utilities, in accordance with Environment Code Chapter 7 exemptions.",
