Stop sign implementation information is taken from SSD Shops Reports and then parsed via python code. Implementation for stop signs will specify where signs are installed or removed, and the work order that the sign installation/removal was spec'd in. \n\nC. UPDATE FREQUENCY  \nUpdated four times a year at the end of each quarter.",
