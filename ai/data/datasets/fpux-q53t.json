    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset consists of San Francisco International Airport (SFO) The aircraft landing dataset contains data about aircraft landings at SFO with monthly landing counts and landed weight by airline, region and aircraft model and type.  \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nData is self-reported by airlines and is only available at a monthly level. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData is available starting in July 1999 and will be updated monthly.\n\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nAirport data is seasonal in nature; therefore, any comparative analyses should be done on a period-over-period basis (i.e. January 2010 vs. January 2009) as opposed to period-to-period (i.e. January 2010 vs. February 2010). It is also important to note that fact and attribute field relationships are not always 1-to-1. For example, Cargo Statistics belonging to United Airlines will appear in multiple attribute fields and are additive, which provides flexibility for the user to derive categorical Cargo Statistics as desired.  \n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\nA summary of monthly comparative air-traffic statistics is also available on SFO’s internet site at\n\nhttps://www.flysfo.com/about/media/facts-statistics/air-traffic-statistics",
