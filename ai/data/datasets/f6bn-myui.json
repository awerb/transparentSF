For example, if your behested payments received total $100,000 on June 12, 2019, you must submit this form by July 12, 2019. You must notify the Ethics Commission that the recipient has received such payment(s) and specify the date on which the payment(s) equaled or exceeded $100,000. \n\nAdditionally, under San Francisco Campaign & Governmental Conduct Code Section 3.630(a)(2), if you filed this report to notify the Ethics Commission that you received behested payments totaling $100,000 or more, you must file this form again between 12 and 13 months following the date on which the payment(s) or payments total $100,000 or more and submit Schedule A. For example, if your behested payments total $100,000 on June 12, 2019, you must submit Schedule A between June 12, 2020 and July 12, 2020.  Filers must disclose all payments made that were funded in whole or in part by the behested payment(s) made at the behest of the City officer and if the person was an interested party in any City decision(s) involving the officer in the 12 months following the date on which the payment(s) were made.\n\nActivity reported on Schedule A1 - Expenditures Report and Schedule A2 - Proceeding(s) Disclosure are available in separate datasets, linked from the dataset primer.",
