    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset maps 2020 census tracts to Analysis Neighborhoods. \n\nThe Department of Public Health and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development, with support from the Planning Department originally created the 41 <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/p5b7-5n3h\">Analysis Neighborhoods</a></u>  by grouping 2010 Census tracts, using common real estate and residents’ definitions for the purpose of providing consistency in the analysis and reporting of socio-economic, demographic, and environmental data, and data on City-funded programs and services. They are not codified in Planning Code nor Administrative Code. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThis dataset is produced by mapping the 2020 Census tracts to Analysis neighborhoods.  \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThis dataset is static. Changes to the census tract boundaries are tracked in multiple datasets. See here for the  <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/bwbp-wk3r\">2010 census tracts assigned to neighborhoods</a></u>\n\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis boundary file can be joined to other census datasets on GEOID, which is the primary key for census tracts in the dataset \n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASET</strong>\n2020 census tract boundaries for San Francisco can be found <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/tmph-tgz9\">here</a></u>",
