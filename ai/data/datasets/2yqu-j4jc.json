    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains the locations of the temporary manifolds (water spigots) that the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) has provided in response to the COVID-19 emergency.\nAll manifolds are open from 7:00am-5:00pm daily. On weekdays, the manifolds are staffed from 9:00-5:00pm with a staff member to monitor and sanitize the station, and provide cups to residents.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe SFPUC manages the manifolds and updates locations as needed.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated automatically daily at 7am. \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis dataset can be used with other geospatial layers to look at the distribution of these COVID response manifolds in relation to other resources or points of interest. It's important to note that these manifolds are additional hand-washing stations that have been distributed during the COVID emergency - this dataset is not representative of all public-access water sources and should not be used to assess broader access to clean water.",
