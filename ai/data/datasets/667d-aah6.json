    "description": "The City of San Francisco owes much of its global appeal to the unique character of its neighborhood commercial districts. OEWD’s Neighborhood Economic Development Division is responsible for the ongoing support and improvement of the City’s many neighborhood commercial districts. The overall goals of the division are to create cleaner, safer and more vibrant neighborhoods in order to increase the quality of life for the City’s residents and workers; and to create economic opportunities for residents of the City’s low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Invest in Neighborhoods Initiative, one of the 17 points of Mayor Lee’s plan for jobs and economic opportunity, provides focused, customized assistance to meet the specific needs of San Francisco’s neighborhood commercial corridors.",
