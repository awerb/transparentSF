    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong> \nThis dataset represents all San Francisco (SF) residents who have received a vaccine for certain respiratory viruses that circulate more heavily in the fall and winter months. All vaccines given to SF residents are included, even if they received their vaccination elsewhere in California. The data are broken down by demographic and geographical stratifications. \n\n<strong>COVID-19:</strong>\nThis dataset represents all SF residents who are considered up to date on their COVID-19 vaccine. A person is up to date if they have received at least one dose of the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine.  <a href=\"https://data.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-vaccine-progress-dashboard-data\">The specific up-to-date criteria can be found on the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) website</a>.  \n\n(Note: As of November 2024, this dataset only contains data regarding COVID-19 vaccinations. This documentation will be updated as other seasonal vaccination data is added). \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong> \nInformation on doses administered to those who live in SF is from the <a href=\"https://cdph.ca.gov/CAIR\">California Immunization Registry (CAIR2)</a>, run by CDPH. The information on individuals’ city of residence, age, race, and ethnicity are also recorded in CAIR and are self-reported at the time of vaccine administration. \n \nIn order to estimate the percent of San Franciscans vaccinated, we provide the 2018-2022 American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for each demographic group and analysis neighborhood.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong> \nUpdated daily via automated process.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong> \nSF population estimates for race/ethnicity and age groups can be found in a <a href = \"https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/SF-COVID-19-reporting-demographics-population-esti/cedd-86uf\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Demographic Census dataset</a>. SF population estimates for analysis neighborhoods can be found in a <a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/SF-COVID-19-reporting-geography-population-estimat/35v5-seg9\">view based on the San Francisco Population and Geography Census dataset</a>. Both of these views use population estimates from the 2018-2022 5-year ACS. \n \nBefore analysis, you must filter the dataset to the desired stratification of data using the “vaccine_type” and \"demographic_group\" columns. For example, filtering “vaccine_type” to “COVID-19” will allow you to only look at rows corresponding to COVID-19 vaccinations. Filtering “demographic_subgroup” to “Analysis Neighborhood” will allow you to only look at rows corresponding to SF neighborhoods. You can then calculate the percentages of those up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations by neighborhood. The “vaccine_subtype” field provides information about the current vaccine product being tracked in this dataset.\n\n<strong>E. CHANGE LOG</strong>\n<LI>11/5/2024 - Dataset updated to reflect up to date status for the 2024-2025 monovalent formulation of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n<LI>7/2/2024 - Population estimates were updated to reflect the most recent ACS data.",
