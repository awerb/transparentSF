    "description": "By filing SFEC Form 128, a candidate for Assessor, Public Defender, City Attorney, District Attorney, Treasurer, Sheriff, the Board of Education or the Community College Board agrees to accept the applicable voluntary expenditure limit.  Candidates who wish to accept the voluntary expenditure ceiling must file this statement no later than the deadline for filing nomination papers. A candidate may not accept the applicable expenditure ceiling if the applicable expenditure ceiling has already been lifted by the Ethics Commission. Any candidate who indicates acceptance of the voluntary expenditure ceiling and who then makes campaign expenditures that exceed the expenditure ceiling, at a time when the expenditure ceiling has not been lifted, is subject to penalties.  This dataset contains filings received starting March 2, 2020.",
