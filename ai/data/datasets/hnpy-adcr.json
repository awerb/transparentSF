    "description": "A. SUMMARY\nThis dataset was created to support local nonprofit organizations seeking qualified and available auditors to perform their auditing work timely. Included in this dataset are accounting firm details on: \n\n1. The budget size of nonprofits the firms are interested in working with\n2. Whether the firms have prior nonprofit auditing experience\n3. The firms' ability to work on-site in San Francisco\n4. The firms' ability to perform Single Audits for nonprofits receiving Federal funding\n5. Additional types of services the firms provide in addition to auditing\n\n\nB. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED\nThe Controller’s Office surveyed over 400 local, state, and national accounting firms to develop this dataset, asking surveyed firms to provide details on their interest and history with conducting nonprofit financial audits. This dataset reflects verbatim the most recent survey responses; firms may not have answered all questions.\n\n\nC. UPDATE PROCESS\nThe Controller's Office provides a live link to allow firms to submit new or updated data at any time. Approximately twice annually, the Controller's Office will refresh the posted dataset with new results submitted in the prior period. \n\n\nD. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET\nUse this dataset to find accounting firms that meet your organization's needs. Please note nonprofit organizations are strongly encouraged to do further outreach and perform additional review of qualifications to confirm firms’ nonprofit auditing expertise and capacity. Nonprofit organizations are also encouraged to do additional research to identify accounting firms best suited for their organization’s needs.\n\n\nE. RELATED DATASETS\nNot applicable.",
