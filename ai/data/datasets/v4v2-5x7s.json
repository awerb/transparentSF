UPDATE FREQUENCY  \nAnnually in the fall, counts are collected the second week of September in coordination with the National Bicycle and Pedestrian Documentation Project. \n\nD. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  \nA bicycle count value of “-1” indicates a null value (bicycle count data was not collected at this location for that year). Bike counts for 2012 are not included in this file, as they are not available/unable to be located. One empty feature from the original “citywide_manual_bicycle_count_locations” (feature 50) was deleted.",
