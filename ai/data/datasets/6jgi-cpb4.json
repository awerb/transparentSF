    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nSnapshot of San Francisco's Development Pipeline as of the end of 2024 Q3. Tracking of construction and entitlement activity based on data from Department of Building Inspection's Permit Tracking System and the Planning Department's Project & Permit Tracking System, processed quarterly. For more information please see http://sfplanning.org/pipeline-report\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe dataset is created by combining projects data from the City Planning Department and permit data from the Building Inspection Department to create a quarterly snapshot that shows when a project is filed to construction.\n\n<strong>C. Previously Published Quarterly Pipeline Datasets</strong>\n As of the end of 2024 Q3, this page serves as the latest snapshot of San Francisco Development Pipeline and will be updated quarterly. All previously published quarterly snapshots currently hosted as separate datasets on the Open Data Portal, will be retired and removed from the portal. To request previous quarterly snapshots of San Francisco Development Pipeline, please contact dataset owner.\n\n<strong>D. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Development Pipeline is updated as a quarterly snapshot of the construction development in the City of San Francisco.\n\n<strong>E. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nEach row or record is a project or permit. They are fitted with information such as address, block lot, project case number and spatial data that allow users to find the specific project. Each row also contains project specific information such as project description and details to illustrate the scope of the project.\n\n<strong>F. DATA NOTES </strong>\n\n<strong>Reporting Update</strong>\nSignificant data and systems improvements are underway to produce a more accurate quarterly pipeline, so the data may change at any time. Weekly and monthly data on Planning Applications and Building Permits can be accessed via the City's Open Data Portal.\n\n<strong>Change in Status Definitions</strong>\nThe following changes have been made in status definitions since the 2022 Q1 Pipeline Report to align the Quarterly Pipeline Reports with other Housing Reports (Housing Inventory and Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Annual Progress) \n\n<strong> (1) Construction: </strong> projects that are authorized for construction deemed to be in the construction stage. A project is considered to be authorized for construction if it has:\n\n- an issued full building permit, OR\n- an issued site permit with an approved first construction document\n\nPast definition: projects that had their first inspection were deemed to be in the construction stage.\n\n<strong> (2) Building Permit Issued: </strong> includes projects that have an issued site permit but don’t yet have their first construction document. Housing units for these projects are not yet counted toward RHNA progress.\n\nPast definition: included projects with any type of permit (site or full building permit) in the issued status.\n\nA data dictionary can be downloaded from the following link: \nhttps://sfplanninggis.s3.amazonaws.com/SF+Quarterly+Developement+Pipeline+Data+Definition+12212023.xlsx",
