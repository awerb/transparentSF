The locations of incidents reported before April 24, 2024 are currently mapped to a slightly different set of intersections than those reported on or after April 24. This may result in slight reporting irregularities for analyses that span this date. We will harmonize all historical data and resolve this as soon as possible.</i>\n\n<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nRead the <u><a href=\"https://sfdigitalservices.gitbook.io/dataset-explainers/sfpd-incident-report-2018-to-present\">detailed overview of this dataset</a></u>.\n\nThis dataset includes incident reports that have been filed as of January 1, 2018. These reports are filed by officers or self-reported by members of the public using SFPD’s online reporting system.  The reports are categorized into the following groups based on how the report was received and the type of incident:\n\n<strong>Initial Reports</strong>: the first report filed for an incident \n<strong>Coplogic Reports</strong>: incident reports filed by members of the public using SFPD’s online reporting system\n<strong>Vehicle Reports</strong>: any incident reports related to stolen and/or recovered vehicles\n\nDisclaimer: The San Francisco Police Department does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness or correct sequencing of the information as the data is subject to change as modifications and updates are completed.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nData is added to open data once incident reports have been reviewed and approved by a supervising Sergeant or Lieutenant. Incident reports may be removed from the dataset if in compliance with court orders to seal records or for administrative purposes such as active internal affair investigations and/or criminal investigations.\n\n<a href=\"https://support.datasf.org/help/police-department-incident-reports-2018-to-present-overview\">Read more about how incident reports are created and approved in the detailed overview of this dataset</a>.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nUpdated automatically daily by 10:00 Pacific\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\n<u><a href=\"https://sfdigitalservices.gitbook.io/dataset-explainers/sfpd-incident-report-2018-to-present\">Read more about</a> </u>how to appropriately use identifiers, interpret different kinds of records, and limitations of analysis related to active privacy controls.",
