    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nBeginning in 2022, <u><a href=\"https://www.sf.gov/rent-board-housing-inventory\">the law requires owners of residential housing units in San Francisco to report certain information about their units to the San Francisco Rent Board on an annual basis</a></u>.  For units (other than condominium units) in buildings of 10 residential units or more, owners were required to begin reporting this information to the Rent Board by July 1, 2022, with updates due on March 1, 2023 and every March 1 thereafter. For condominium units and units in buildings with less than 10 residential units, reporting began on March 1, 2023 with updates due every March 1 thereafter. Owners are also required to inform the Rent Board within 30 days of any change in the name or business contact information of the owner or designated property manager. The Rent Board uses this information to create and maintain a “housing inventory” of all units in San Francisco that are subject to the Rent Ordinance. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe Rent Board has developed a secure website  <u><a href=\"https://portal.sfrb.org/FrontPortal/Page/RenderPage?tabId=20\">portal</a></u> that provides an interface for owners to submit the required information (The Housing Inventory). The Rent Board uses the information provided to generate reports and surveys, to investigate and analyze rents and vacancies, to monitor compliance with the Rent Ordinance, and to assist landlords and tenants and other City departments as needed. The Rent Board may not use the information to operate a “rental registry” within the meaning of California Civil Code Sections 1947.7 – 1947.8.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Housing Inventory is continuously updated as it receives submissions from the public. The portal is available to the public 24/7. The Rent Board Staff also makes regular updates to the data during regular business hours, and the data is shared to DataSF every 24 hours.  \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nIt is important to note that this dataset contains information submitted by residential property owners and tenants. The Rent Board does not review or verify the accuracy of the data submitted. Please note that historical data is subject to change. \n\n<strong>Notes for Analysis</strong>\n- Addresses have been anonymized to the block level\n- Latitude & Longitude are the closest mid-block point to the unit\n- Each row is a unit. To count total units, first select a year then count unique ids. Do not sum unit count.",
