    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset consists of San Francisco International Airport (SFO) aircraft noise reports and if available, the correlated flight operation’s details for those reports. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nSFO Noise Office collects this information via the WebTrak, Web, App, Complaint Hotline, emails, letters, and telephone calls to our office. This information is compiled and published in a monthly report which is presented at the SFO Airport Community Roundtable meetings (https://sforoundtable.org/). It serves to help understand community's aircraft noise concerns, to collaborate with all stakeholders in an effort to reduce and manage aircraft noise.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nData is available starting in August 2019 and will be updated on a monthly basis.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nThis data is the data source used to produce the Noise Reports section on page 5 of the monthly Airport Director’s Report. These reports are available online at https://www.flysfo.com/about/community-noise/noise-office/reports/airport-directors-report\n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\nPreviously provided data, Aircraft Noise Complaint Data, from January 2005 to July 2019 is available here: https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Aircraft-Noise-Complaint-Data/q3xd-hfi8\n\nPlease contact the Noise Abatement Office at NoiseAbatementOffice@flysfo.com for any questions regarding this data.",
