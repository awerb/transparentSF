    "description": "<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset contains a list of intersections impacted by upcoming and current street closures occurring as a result of the Shared Spaces program, certain special events, and some construction work. This dataset only includes street closures permitted by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). It doesn’t include street closures managed by other City departments such as Public Works or the Police Department.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe data is exported from the Street Closure Salesforce database which is maintained by the SFMTA ISCOTT unit and converted to the geometry of streets and intersections based on closed street extent descriptions.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nDatabase is updated constantly. This report is issued daily.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nPlease be aware that this dataset only contains temporary street closure events that are permitted (“status = permitted”).\n\nThis dataset contains various types of street closures. If you are looking for a particular type please use the TYPE field to select the appropriate closure type (Ex. type = Shared Space).\n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<li>For street segments affected by temporary street closures (rather than the intersection points provided here), please see the \n<u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/8x25-yybr\">Temporary Street Closures</a></u> dataset. </li>\n<li>For street closures in the WZDx standard format, see the   \n<u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/4ftp-yz2f\">Temporary Street Closures in the Work Zone Data Exchange (WZDx) Format</a></u> dataset. </li>",
