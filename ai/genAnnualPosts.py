    First, identify and clearly state the most significant long-term trends (5-10 years) in {category}. 
    When searching your docs, if the cagtegory is:
    "public safety", then be sure to include an analysis of police incident reports including property and violent crime trends.  
    "economy and community", then be sure to include an analysis of 311 calls.
    "health and social services", then be sure to include an analysis of overdose deaths,  changes in demographics of jail bookings.
    "housing", then be sure to include an analysis of building permits and vacancy data.

     Then, find specific, concrete examples that bring these trends to life like recent anomalies, which compare 2024 to perior year averages. 

    For each trend:
    1. State the clear, overarching pattern supported by data, include an illustrative chart.
    2. Provide specific, detailed and memorable examples that illustrate the trend, include an illustrative chart.
    3. Include the query URL to the original data. The FULL URL including the ENTIRE QUERY is required.
    4. Reference the most compelling chart that visualizes the story, anomaly charts can be especially compelling.

    Your style is dry and factual - vulcan like.  No need to be overly verbose.  Don't speculate.  Just state the facts.
