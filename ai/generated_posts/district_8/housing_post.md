I was unable to find specific data on housing metrics such as average rent, housing units built, eviction notices, and housing complaints directly. However, I can provide some insights and notable trends in District 8 using other related data available that may have impacts on housing indirectly. Here are some significant trends along with data sources:

1. **Notices of Violation:**
   - Overarching Trend: In 2024, there was a significant decrease in Notices of Violation issued by the Department of Building Inspection in District 8. This count dropped by 56% compared to the 2023 total.
   - Memorable Example: In December 2024, the count was 1,190, representing a 26% decrease compared to the 10-year average of 1,603.

These insights are derived from trends in violations and incidents which can indirectly depict housing scenarios, as fewer violations might indicate improved housing conditions but could also point to reduced housing enforcement or reporting. Further closely related data analysis might be necessary to draw complete conclusions specific to direct housing metrics.
